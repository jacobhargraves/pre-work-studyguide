# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This application was designed to provide a template to save and review notes taken during the prework for the bootcamp.  It allows students to view notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript as well as provides a suggestion on study topics when using the console tool. During this project I learned a lot about the different syntax for each programming language as well as some of the logic used in JavaScript
